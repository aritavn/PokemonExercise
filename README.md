# Pokemon - Premium Minds Exercise

For this exercise I implemented an API with Java and a web application with Angular.

## API

In the pokemon-api folder is an API developed using Java 11 and Spring.

###Run

To run the program just run the file PokemonApiApplication.java.
Requests to the API can be made with a GET request to http://localhost:8080/pokemon?moves={directions_string}

###Tests

To run the tests, run the file PokemonApiApplicationTests.java


## Web App

The game can be played through a web application developed using Angular 9, which is in the pokemon-webapp folder.

###Run

Run the API.
You should have node.js installed and run the following commands in the project directory.
```bash
npm install
ng serve -o
```
